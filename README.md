# Cryptography

Input
The input consists of a sequence of integer pairs n and p with each integer on a line by itself. For all such pairs 
1≤n≤200, 1≤p<10^101 and there exists an integer k,1≤k≤10^9 such that k^n =p.

Output
For each integer pair n and p the value √n p should be printed, i.e., the number k such that kn = p.
